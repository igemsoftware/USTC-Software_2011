This folder contains scripts for testing with the SBML SEMANTIC TEST SUITE,
and result and log files for tests with the version 
released on Tue, 19 Oct 2004.

To reproduce the result files, download and unpack the SBML Semantic Test Suite 
from http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~afinney/semantic-test-suite.tar.gz
unpack, and  

edit the file `odeSolver-wrapper-once.pl' 

to add the correct path for the odeSolver application. Then

copy odeSolver-wrapper.bsh and odeSolver-wrapper-once.pl

to the folder semantic-test-suite/AUTOMATION/wrappers, change to the directory 
semantic-test-suite and run 

`runtests.bsh -vwrapper=AUTOMATION/wrappers/odeSolver-wrapper.bsh >> testlog.txt'

in a bash or shell.



odeSolver-wrapper.bsh:
	A bash script to call odeSolver-wrapper-once.pl several times, 
	if the previous run failed, passing a lower absolute error treshold.
	This script is called from the scripts provided by the Test Suite,
	and adds the absolute error value. It start with a very low error,
	and tries again with higher error tolerance if the SBML_odeSolver
	failed.
odeSolver-wrapper-once.pl:
        A Perl script that calls the SBML_odeSolver, with time/printstep 
	values passed by the calling Test Suite script (runtests.bsh/test.bsh) 
	and an error value added by the script odeSolver-wrapper.bsh.
	It then reads the output of the SBML_odeSolver, and writes 
	results to testout.csv needed by the Test Suite scripts.
	If CVODE fails, it writes TRY AGAIN as a message to the calling
	script, to try again with higher error tolerance.
	It also writes a log file "testlog.txt" of SBML_odeSolver output 
	during the test run.
testlog.txt:
	A log file from one test run with all provided tests of the 
	SBML Semantic Test Suite, produced by calling the runtests.bsh
	script with `runtests.bsh -vwrapper=odeSolver-wrapper.bsh >> testlog.txt.
	Thus this file contains the outputs of 
	a) runtests.bsh
	b) the wrapper script odeSolver-wrapper-once.pl, and
	c) the odeSolver itself (via (b)).
workingtest.txt:
	Text file used by runtests.txt, contains all tests that tested
	correctly with the SBML_odeSolver; not working tests are commented
	out by removing `TEST' and `.test' text.
testlist.txt:
	Original testlist provided by the SBML Semantic Test Suite
