Work remaining on SBML_odeSolver for Microsoft Visual C++ 7.1
=============================================================

Find a way to avoid including the CVODE code within the project.
Its included at the moment because its patched to export functions to
SBML_odeSolver.

Create a proper installer 

Clean up headers so that its possible to create a useable library release rather than
just an .exe release.
