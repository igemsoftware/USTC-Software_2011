USING THE SOSlib COMMANDLINE APPLICATIONS

The best documentation for both the usage of the command-line application
odeSolver/SBML_odeSolverApp and of some example applications 
can be found online at
http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~raim/odeSolver/doc/app.html

The README file in the main directory also gives short instructions.

Running odeSolver -h will give you an overview of input options.




USING SOSlib AS A LIBRARY (API)

You can either run `doxygen SOSlib.doxy' in the main folder, which will
produce documentation files in this folder.

Alternatively you can access the doxygen documentation online at
http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~raim/odeSolver/doc/api.html

The example applications (folder applications) show how to use
SOSlib as a library.

The source code of the library (folder src), the main command-line
application (folder odeSolver) and the example applications (folder
examples) is well documented. You can also just see there for 
information.
